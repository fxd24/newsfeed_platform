    "body": "Security researchers have uncovered a sophisticated supply chain attack targeting popular NPM packages used in enterprise JavaScript applications. The attack involves compromising package maintainer accounts and injecting malicious code that executes during the build process. The malicious code establishes persistence by modifying webpack configurations and can exfiltrate source code, environment variables, and deployment credentials. Over 200 packages have been identified as compromised, with millions of downloads combined. The attack appears to be the work of a nation-state actor based on code analysis and infrastructure attribution. Organizations using Node.js should immediately audit their package dependencies, review build processes for unauthorized modifications, and implement package integrity verification. A full list of compromised packages and indicators of compromise are available in the appendix. The attack demonstrates the critical importance of software supply chain security and the need for comprehensive dependency management strategies.",
